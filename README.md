# PowerQuery-Food-Data-Analysis
In addition to the previous tool created using Python, I wanted to also do an analysis of the food data using Excel. 

For this specific project, I decided to create a different tool. Instead of analyzing every nutrient, I decided to create a macro tracker using the food database. This is going to help me (and anyone else) accurately track my Carb, Fat, and Protein intake while trying to gain muscle mass.
